Skill Topics (#56): a new primitive for grouping skills. A `Topic` is a named, owner-curated group with its own privacy flag; skills belong to many topics via a separate `topic_skills` edge collection so neither side carries back-pointing arrays.

**Backend.** Endpoints: `POST /api/topics`, `GET /api/topics`, `GET /api/topics/:idOrName`, `PUT /api/topics/:id`, `DELETE /api/topics/:id`, `POST /api/topics/:id/skills`, `DELETE /api/topics/:id/skills/:skillGuid`. `GET /api/skill-search` also accepts an optional `?topic=<name>` filter. Topic names are globally-unique kebab-case and immutable; visibility rules mirror skills (private topic → owner + admin only; a private skill placed in a public topic stays hidden from non-authorized viewers). Skill hard-delete cascades membership. No migration required.

**Frontend.** New Topics tab on Registry, `/topics/:idOrName` detail page, create / edit / delete modals, add-skills picker (multi-select search across public + user's private skills), per-card remove button on the topic detail page, and a topic-filter dropdown on the Public / My Skills tabs that narrows results to a topic's members.
