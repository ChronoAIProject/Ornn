feat: per-version audit history + analytics filtering (#181) and skill pull tracking with time-bucket aggregation (#182). 

Backend: `GET /api/v1/skills/:idOrName/analytics` and `/audit/history` accept `?version=`. New `GET /api/v1/skills/:idOrName/analytics/pulls?bucket=hour|day|month&from=&to=&version=` returns bucketed pull counts grouped by source (api/web/playground). Three endpoints now emit fire-and-forget pull events into a new `skill_pulls` collection: `GET /skills/:idOrName/json` (api), `GET /skills/:idOrName` (web), `POST /playground/chat` when bound to a skill (playground). Analytics failures are swallowed and never surface to clients.

Frontend: `AuditHistoryCard` and `AnalyticsCard` accept a `version` prop and pass it through; the dedicated `/skills/:idOrName/audits` page reads `?version=` from the URL so version selection on `SkillDetailPage` propagates to the deep-link. New `useSkillPulls` hook ready for the chart UI in #187.
