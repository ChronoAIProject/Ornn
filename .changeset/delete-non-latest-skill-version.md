feat: delete a non-latest skill version (#183). New endpoint `DELETE /api/v1/skills/:idOrName/versions/:version` (owner or `ornn:admin:skill`). Refuses to delete the only remaining version (use `DELETE /skills/:id`) or the current latest (publish a newer version first). The version's package zip is best-effort cleaned from storage; the row is removed from `skill_versions`. Frontend: per-row Delete button on `SkillVersionList` (owner / admin only, hidden for the latest row), confirmation modal, and a SkillDetailPage handler that toasts the result and snaps back to latest if the user was viewing the deleted version.
