Skill registry reorganized around access scope: new 3-tab layout (Public / My Skills / Shared with me) with per-tab counts and filter chips for grant orgs/users. System-skill classification is now derived per-caller from NyxID user-service tag matches rather than stored as a dedicated field. Permissions modal redesigned into three access tiers (Public / Limited / Private) with co-equal Org + User grant channels, focus-open email picker, and chip labels that resolve to real names via a new `/api/users/resolve` endpoint. Backend write paths now read user identity from the decoded NyxID identity token instead of the X-User-* headers that the proxy strips, fixing stale empty `userEmail`/`userDisplayName` fields that caused raw GUIDs to render in UI bylines. Theme-aware Logo component with dark/light variants and reorganized profile dropdown.
