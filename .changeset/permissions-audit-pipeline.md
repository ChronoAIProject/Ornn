feat: audit-gated permissions pipeline. `PUT /api/v1/skills/:id/permissions` now orchestrates the full audit + waiver flow — removals apply immediately, new grants (user/org/public) run a cached audit (30-day TTL per skill version) and either auto-apply when `overallScore >= platform threshold` or create a waiver request requiring owner justification + reviewer decision. The dedicated `POST /api/v1/skills/:idOrName/share` endpoint + the separate "Share" button are gone — everything happens through "Manage permissions". Threshold is admin-configurable at `/admin/settings` (default 6.0, range 0–10). The PermissionsModal shows a three-phase UX (form → running → results) so the user can see the audit progress and act on any flagged targets inline.
