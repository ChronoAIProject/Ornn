feat: redesign the GitHub-link feature around a single folder URL + manual sync.

**Backend.**

- New `parseGithubUrl(url)` helper accepts the canonical folder URL a user copies from the browser address bar (e.g. `https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/<ref>/<path>`) and returns `{ repo, ref, path }`. Bare-repo URLs and the `tree/<ref>` form (no path) work too. `blob/` URLs and non-github hosts are rejected. 11 unit tests.
- New endpoint `PUT /api/v1/skills/:id/source` attaches (or clears, with `{ githubUrl: null }`) a GitHub source pointer on an existing skill *without* pulling. Auth: skill author or platform admin + `ornn:skill:update`. Lets a user link an originally hand-uploaded skill to its GitHub source first and trigger the sync separately. The stored `source` is missing `lastSyncedAt`/`lastSyncedCommit` until the first sync.
- `POST /api/v1/skills/:id/refresh` now accepts `{ dryRun?: boolean, skipValidation?: boolean }`. When `dryRun: true`: pulls from the linked source, computes a structured diff against the current latest version, and returns `{ skill, source, pendingVersion, hasChanges, diff }` without bumping. Powers the preview-then-confirm flow on the detail-page Advanced Options panel. When `dryRun: false`: existing behavior; `skipValidation` opts out of the format validator on the pulled package.
- `POST /api/v1/skills/pull` now accepts `githubUrl` (preferred) alongside the existing `repo`/`ref`/`path` form, so the build flow can post the same single-URL form the panel uses.
- `SkillSource.lastSyncedAt` / `lastSyncedCommit` are now optional on both the API and SDK shape, reflecting the new "linked but never synced" state.
- New activity-log entries `skill:source_link` / `skill:source_unlink`.

**Frontend.**

- New "Link to GitHub" panel inside the `AdvancedOptionsModal` on the skill detail page. Single URL input, skip-validation checkbox, plus Save / Sync / Unlink buttons. Sync runs the dry-run preview → if no changes detected, toasts "already in sync"; otherwise switches the panel into a Sync-preview view that renders the diff via the new `VersionDiffView` component and asks the user to confirm with an "Apply sync" button.
- `VersionDiffView` is a new pure renderer extracted from `VersionDiffModal` (which now consumes it) so the diff layout is shared between the version-compare modal and the GitHub sync preview.
- `/skills/new/from-github` page redesigned to take a single GitHub folder URL + skip-validation toggle. Submitting calls `POST /skills/pull` with the URL and routes the user to the new skill's detail page.
- New API client functions `setSkillSource`, `previewSkillRefresh`, plus hooks `useSetSkillSource`, `usePreviewSkillRefresh`. `useRefreshSkillFromSource` now takes `{ guid, skipValidation? }` so the Apply-sync step can opt out of validation.
